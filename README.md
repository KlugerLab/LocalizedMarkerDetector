# LocalMarkerDetector

LMD is a computational framework designed for the identification of gene expression markers localized to specific cell populations within single-cell RNA sequencing data.

## Get Started

[Get started with LMD](https://github.com/ruiqi0130/LocalMarkerDetector/blob/main/Demo_marrow_facs.Rmd) by exploring our mouse bone marrow example.

## Files

- `demo_marrow.rds`: A demonstration file showcasing how to apply LMD on a mouse bone marrow dataset.
- `mark_benchmark.rds`: Utilize this file to reproduce the benchmark results presented in our study, comparing LMD's performance against other methods.
- `paper_figure.rds`: This file includes the necessary data to reproduce the figures in our publication.
